# DIABETES_DIAGNOSIS

## 🩺 Diabetes Prediction and Analysis using Machine Learning

This project presents a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline for **diabetes diagnosis and prediction** using machine learning models. It explores the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset through data cleaning, visualization, feature scaling, model building, and ensemble techniques such as **Stacking** and **Voting Classifiers**.

### 🔍 Key Features

- 📊 **Data Preprocessing & Exploration**
  - Handling missing values using imputation
  - Statistical analysis and summary statistics
  - Correlation matrix and feature visualization

- 📈 **Data Visualization**
  - Histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, boxplots, and pair plots to understand distributions and relationships

- 🧠 **Model Building**
  - Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
  - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

- 🤖 **Ensemble Learning**
  - Stacking Classifier with Logistic Regression as meta-model
  - Soft Voting Classifier for improved prediction

- 🧪 **Model Evaluation**
